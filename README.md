#### A) Real Scenario:
Imagine you have a Laravel application where admin doing some tasks like:  sending email to users from the application’s email facilities. So, how the logged in user knows that an important email dispatched to him while he is also doing his task in the application? May be the logged in user by clicking the email lists button to check if there has any new email arrived or may be another option – automatic notification that a new email arrived. For the first scenario when clicking email list button to view, an API request can call to retrieve the email list or by refreshing, reloading pages but for the second, need a mechanism to notify user that a new email arrived and here comes the WebSockets that are used to implement real-time, live-updating user interfaces.
